Dockerfile for Nagios container
This is a basic Dockerfile that will use CentOS6.7.  It installs all the necessary rpm's to run an out of the box nagos container.  Once the container is started nagios and related services should be up and running.  You will need to add your servers, and service checks to start monitoring your boxes.
